abstract = { Fine-scale evolutionary dynamics can be challenging to tease out when focused on the broad brush strokes of whole populations over long time spans. We propose a suite of diagnostic analysis techniques that operate on lineages and phylogenies in digital evolution experiments, with the aim of improving our capacity to quantitatively explore the nuances of evolutionary histories in digital evolution experiments. We present three types of lineage measurements: lineage length, mutation accumulation, and phenotypic volatility. Additionally, we suggest the adoption of four phylogeny measurements from biology: phylogenetic richness, phylogenetic divergence, phylogenetic regularity, and depth of the most-recent common ancestor. In addition to quantitative metrics, we also discuss several existing data visualizations that are useful for understanding lineages and phylogenies: state sequence visualizations, fitness landscape overlays, phylogenetic trees, and Muller plots. We examine the behavior of these metrics (with the aid of data visualizations) in two well-studied computational contexts: (1) a set of two-dimensional, real-valued optimization problems under a range of mutation rates and selection strengths, and (2) a set of qualitatively different environments in the Avida digital evolution platform. These results confirm our intuition about how these metrics respond to various evolutionary conditions and indicate their broad value. },

	abstract = {Open-ended evolution researchers seek to create systems that continually produce new evolutionary outcomes, attempting to reflect the power and diversity of evolution in nature. The specific metrics used (novelty, complexity, diversity, etc) vary by researcher, but the holy grail would be a system where any of these can accumulate indefinitely. Of course, one challenge that we face in reaching this goal is even recognizing if we have succeeded. To determine the evolutionary potential of a system, we must conduct finite experiments; based on their results we can predict how we would expect evolution to progress were it to continue. Here we examine how such predictions might be made and how accurate they might be. We focus on predicting fitness; this metric is often easy to calculate, and correlated with increases in traits like novelty and complexity. For each run in a simple digital evolution experiment, we find the best fit to measured values of fitness, and demonstrate that projecting this fit out usually predicts that fitness will be constrained by an asymptote. Upon extending the experiments, however, we see that fitness often far exceeds this asymptote, belying the boundedness that it implies. Extending past a premature end point allows us to see beyond this "boundedness illusion"},

	abstract = {Building more open-ended evolutionary systems can simultaneously advance our understanding of biology, artificial life, and evolutionary computation. In order to do so, however, we need a way to determine when we are moving closer to this goal. We propose a set of metrics that allow us to measure a system's ability to produce commonly-agreed-upon hallmarks of open-ended evolution: change potential, novelty potential, complexity potential, and ecological potential. Our goal is to make these metrics easy to incorporate into a system, and comparable across systems so that we can make coherent progress as a field. To this end, we provide detailed algorithms (including C++ implementations) for these metrics that should be easy to incorporate into existing artificial life systems. Furthermore, we expect this toolbox to continue to grow as researchers implement these metrics in new languages and as the community reaches consensus about additional hallmarks of open-ended evolution. For example, we would welcome a measurement of a system's potential to produce major transitions in individuality. To confirm that our metrics accurately measure the hallmarks we are interested in, we test them on two very different experimental systems: {NK} landscapes and the Avida digital evolution platform. We find that our observed results are consistent with our prior knowledge about these systems, suggesting that our proposed metrics are effective and should generalize to other systems.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary dynamics created by a given evolutionary algorithm is a critical step in determining which ones are most likely to produce desirable outcomes for a given problem. While it is relatively easy to come up with hypotheses that could plausibly explain observed evolutionary outcomes, we often fail to take the next step of confirming that our proposed mechanism accurately describes the underlying evolutionary dynamics. Visualization is a powerful tool for exploring evolutionary history as it actually played out. We can create visualizations that summarize the evolutionary history of a population or group of populations by drawing representative lineages on top of the fitness landscape being traversed. This approach integrates information about the adaptations that took place with information about the evolutionary pressures they were being subjected to as they evolved. However, these visualizations can be challenging to depict on a two-dimensional surface, as they integrate multiple forms of three-dimensional (or more) data. Here, we propose an alternative: taking advantage of recent advances in virtual reality to view evolutionary history in three dimensions. This technique produces an intuitive and detailed illustration of evolutionary processes. A demo of our visualization is available here: https://emilydolson.github.io/fitness\_landscape\_visualizations.},

	doi = {10.1101/148973},
	abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity is believed to be an evolutionary driver of biodiversity. Variability in the distribution of resource patches can allow an environment to support a wider variety of phenotypes for selection to act upon at the ecosystem level, which may lead to more species. However, the generality of this principle has not been thoroughly tested, as the relevant adaptive dynamics occur on evolutionary timescales. We overcame this challenge by performing experiments on populations of digital organisms in the Avida Digital Evolution Platform, in which we investigated the impact of spatial resource heterogeneity on phenotypic diversity. Since an important benefit of diversity may be increased evolutionary potential, we also tracked the probability of a complex trait evolving in the context of various levels of spatial heterogeneity. We found that spatial entropy and phenotypic diversity have a strong positive correlation and this relationship is consistent across various spatial configurations. Diversity also increases evolutionary potential, but has a much smaller impact than other components of environmental composition. The most important of these components was the mean number of resources present in locations across the environment, likely owing to the importance of building blocks for the evolution of complex features. These results suggest that a general relationship exists between spatial heterogeneity and diversity, beyond the specific ecosystems and timescales in which it has previously been studied. By examining this relationship in the context of phenotypic evolution, we advance a mechanistic understanding of the resulting dynamics. Moreover, our results suggest that the likelihood of evolving various traits can be impacted by the spatial configuration of patches in which these traits are advantageous. These findings have implications for both evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation, as generating and maintaining diversity is critical to all forms of evolution.},

abstract="In natural ecologies, niches are created, altered, or destroyed, driving populations to continually change and produce novel features. Here, we explore an approach to guiding evolution via the power of niches: ecologically-mediated hints. The original exploration of ecologically-mediated hints occurred in Eco-EA, an algorithm in which an experimenter provides a primary fitness function for a tough problem that they are trying to solve, as well as ``hints'' that are associated with limited resources. We hypothesize that other evolutionary algorithms that create niches, such as lexicase selection, can be provided hints in a similar way. Here, we use a toy problem to investigate the expected benefits of using this approach to solve more challenging problems. Of course, since humans are notoriously bad at choosing fitness functions, user-provided advice may be misleading. Thus, we also explore the impact of misleading hints. As expected, we find that informative hints facilitate solving the problem. However, the mechanism of niche-creation (Eco-EA vs. lexicase selection) dramatically impacts the algorithm's robustness to misleading hints.",

abstract="MAP-Elites is an evolutionary computation technique that has proven valuable for exploring and illuminating the genotype-phenotype space of a computational problem. In MAP-Elites, a population is structured based on phenotypic traits of prospective solutions; each cell represents a distinct combination of traits and maintains only the most fit organism found with those traits. The resulting map of trait combinations allows the user to develop a better understanding of how each trait relates to fitness and how traits interact. While MAP-Elites has not been demonstrated to be competitive for identifying the optimal Pareto front, the insights it provides do allow users to better understand the underlying problem. In particular, MAP-Elites has provided insight into the underlying structure of problem representations, such as the value of connection cost or modularity to evolving neural networks. Here, we extend the use of MAP-Elites to examine genetic programming representations, using aspects of program architecture as traits to explore. We demonstrate that MAP-Elites can generate programs with a much wider range of architectures than other evolutionary algorithms do (even those that are highly successful at maintaining diversity), which is not surprising as this is the purpose of MAP-Elites. Ultimately, we propose that MAP-Elites is a useful tool for understanding why genetic programming representations succeed or fail and we suggest that it should be used to choose selection techniques and tune parameters.",

abstract="Lexicase selection is a proven parent-selection algorithm designed for genetic programming problems, especially for uncompromising test-based problems where many distinct test cases must all be passed. Previous work has shown that random subsampling techniques can improve lexicase selection's problem-solving success; here, we investigate why. We test two types of random subsampling lexicase variants: down-sampled lexicase, which uses a random subset of all training cases each generation; and cohort lexicase, which collects candidate solutions and training cases into small groups for testing, reshuffling those groups each generation. We show that both of these subsampling lexicase variants improve problem-solving success by facilitating deeper evolutionary searches; that is, they allow populations to evolve for more generations (relative to standard lexicase) given a fixed number of test-case evaluations. We also demonstrate that the subsampled variants require less computational effort to find solutions, even though subsampling hinders lexicase's ability to preserve specialists. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find any evidence of systematic loss of phenotypic diversity maintenance due to subsampling, though we did find evidence that cohort lexicase is significantly better at preserving phylogenetic diversity than down-sampled lexicase.",

	abstract = {Conservation ecologists have long argued over the best way of placing reserves across an environment to maximize population diversity. Many have studied the effect of protecting many small regions of an ecosystem vs. a single large region, with varied results. However, this research tends to ignore evolutionary dynamics under the rationale that the spatiotemporal scale required is prohibitive. We used the Avida digital evolution research platform to overcome this barrier and study the response of phenotypic diversity to eight different reserve placement configurations. The capacity for mutation,and therefore evolution, substantially altered the dynamics of diversity in the population. When mutations were allowed, reserve configurations involving a greater number of consequently smaller reserves were substantially more effective at maintaining existing diversity and generating new diversity. However, when mutations were disallowed, reserve configuration had little effect on diversity generation and maintenance. While further research is necessary before translating these results into policy decisions, this study demonstrates the importance of considering evolution when making such decisions and suggests that a larger number of smaller reserves may have evolutionary benefits.},

In the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve PPE, including decontamination after use. In this study, we outline a procedure by which PPE may be decontaminated using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories. According to the literature, effective decontamination of N95 respirator masks or surgical masks requires UV-C doses of greater than 1 Jcm−2, which was achieved after 4.3 hours per side when placing the N95 at the bottom of the BSCs tested in this study. We then demonstrated complete inactivation of the human coronavirus NL63 on N95 mask material after 15 minutes of UV-C exposure at 61 cm (232 μWcm−2).

Great progress has been made in quantitative modelling of evolution using fitness landscapes, allowing a degree of prediction for future evolutionary histories. Yet fine-grained control of the speed and distributions of these trajectories remains elusive. We propose an approach to achieve this using ideas originally developed in a completely different context—counterdiabatic driving to control the behaviour of quantum states for applications like quantum computing and manipulating ultracold atoms. Implementing these ideas for the first time in a biological context, we show how a set of external control parameters (that is, varying drug concentrations and types, temperature and nutrients) can guide the probability distribution of genotypes in a population along a specified path and time interval. This level of control, allowing empirical optimization of evolutionary speed and trajectories, has myriad potential applications, from enhancing adaptive therapies for diseases to the development of thermotolerant crops in preparation for climate change, to accelerating bioengineering methods built on evolutionary models, like directed evolution of biomolecules.},

    ABSTRACT={In digital evolution, populations of computational organisms evolve via the same principles that govern natural selection in nature. These platforms have been used to great effect as a controlled system in which to conduct evolutionary experiments and develop novel evolutionary theory. In addition to their complex evolutionary dynamics, many digital evolution systems also produce rich ecological communities. As a result, digital evolution is also a powerful tool for research on eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here, we review the research to date in which digital evolution platforms have been used to address eco-evolutionary (and in some cases purely ecological) questions. This work has spanned a wide range of topics, including competition, facilitation, parasitism, predation, and macroecological scaling laws. We argue for the value of further ecological research in digital evolution systems and present some particularly promising directions for further research.}

	abstract = {Diversity is associated with success in evolutionary algorithms. To date, diversity in evolutionary computation research has mostly been measured by counting the number of distinct candidate solutions in the population at a given time point. Here, we aim to investigate the value of phylogenetic diversity, which takes into account the evolutionary history of a population. To understand how informative phylogenetic diversity is, we run experiments on a set of diagnostic fitness landscapes under a range of different selection schemes. We find that phylogenetic diversity can be more predictive of future success than traditional diversity metrics under some conditions, particularly for fitness landscapes with a single, challenging-to-find global optimum. Our results suggest that phylogenetic diversity metrics should be more widely incorporated into research on diversity in evolutionary computation.},
