	abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary dynamics created by a given evolutionary algorithm is a critical step in determining which ones are most likely to produce desirable outcomes for a given problem. While it is relatively easy to come up with hypotheses that could plausibly explain observed evolutionary outcomes, we often fail to take the next step of confirming that our proposed mechanism accurately describes the underlying evolutionary dynamics. Visualization is a powerful tool for exploring evolutionary history as it actually played out. We can create visualizations that summarize the evolutionary history of a population or group of populations by drawing representative lineages on top of the fitness landscape being traversed. This approach integrates information about the adaptations that took place with information about the evolutionary pressures they were being subjected to as they evolved. However, these visualizations can be challenging to depict on a two-dimensional surface, as they integrate multiple forms of three-dimensional (or more) data. Here, we propose an alternative: taking advantage of recent advances in virtual reality to view evolutionary history in three dimensions. This technique produces an intuitive and detailed illustration of evolutionary processes. A demo of our visualization is available here: https://emilydolson.github.io/fitness\_landscape\_visualizations.},

	abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity is believed to be an evolutionary driver of biodiversity. Variability in the distribution of resource patches can allow an environment to support a wider variety of phenotypes for selection to act upon at the ecosystem level, which may lead to more species. However, the generality of this principle has not been thoroughly tested, as the relevant adaptive dynamics occur on evolutionary timescales. We overcame this challenge by performing experiments on populations of digital organisms in the Avida Digital Evolution Platform, in which we investigated the impact of spatial resource heterogeneity on phenotypic diversity. Since an important benefit of diversity may be increased evolutionary potential, we also tracked the probability of a complex trait evolving in the context of various levels of spatial heterogeneity. We found that spatial entropy and phenotypic diversity have a strong positive correlation and this relationship is consistent across various spatial configurations. Diversity also increases evolutionary potential, but has a much smaller impact than other components of environmental composition. The most important of these components was the mean number of resources present in locations across the environment, likely owing to the importance of building blocks for the evolution of complex features. These results suggest that a general relationship exists between spatial heterogeneity and diversity, beyond the specific ecosystems and timescales in which it has previously been studied. By examining this relationship in the context of phenotypic evolution, we advance a mechanistic understanding of the resulting dynamics. Moreover, our results suggest that the likelihood of evolving various traits can be impacted by the spatial configuration of patches in which these traits are advantageous. These findings have implications for both evolutionary biology and evolutionary computation, as generating and maintaining diversity is critical to all forms of evolution.},

	abstract = {Conservation ecologists have long argued over the best way of placing reserves across an environment to maximize population diversity. Many have studied the effect of protecting many small regions of an ecosystem vs. a single large region, with varied results. However, this research tends to ignore evolutionary dynamics under the rationale that the spatiotemporal scale required is prohibitive. We used the Avida digital evolution research platform to overcome this barrier and study the response of phenotypic diversity to eight different reserve placement configurations. The capacity for mutation,and therefore evolution, substantially altered the dynamics of diversity in the population. When mutations were allowed, reserve configurations involving a greater number of consequently smaller reserves were substantially more effective at maintaining existing diversity and generating new diversity. However, when mutations were disallowed, reserve configuration had little effect on diversity generation and maintenance. While further research is necessary before translating these results into policy decisions, this study demonstrates the importance of considering evolution when making such decisions and suggests that a larger number of smaller reserves may have evolutionary benefits.},

	abstract = {Fine-scale evolutionary dynamics can be challenging to tease out when focused on broad brush strokes of whole populations over long timespans. We propose a suite of diagnostic metrics that operate on lineages and phylogenies in digital evolution experiments with the aim of improving our capacity to quantitatively explore the nuances of evolutionary histories in digital evolution experiments. We present three types of lineage measurements: lineage length, mutation accumulation, and phenotypic volatility. Additionally, we suggest the adoption of four phylogeny measurements from biology: depth of the most-recent common ancestor, phylogenetic richness, phylogenetic divergence, and phylogenetic regularity. We demonstrate the use of each metric on a set of two-dimensional, real-valued optimization problems under a range of mutation rates and selection strengths, conﬁrming our intuitions about what they can tell us about evolutionary dynamics.},

Evolutionary biologists are primarily interested in the population dynamics that produce diversity, ecologists want to understand the maintenance and community-level effects of diversity, and evolutionary computation researchers want to exploit diversity to produce better and more varied solutions to real-world problems. In artiﬁcial life, we are particularly interested in understanding diversity as a critical component of natural systems in order to produce artiﬁcial ones that exhibit comparable open-ended dynamics. Here we begin to develop a framework to unite these views on diversity, with a goal of facilitating the transfer of ideas among these ﬁelds and formulating a consistent vocabulary.},
